** Genetic algorithm for function maximum **
Genetic algorithm for finding the maximum of a positive function over a given domain (must be positive over the domain). The algorithm uses binary encoding, roulette-wheel + elitist selection, one-point crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of candidate solutions.
